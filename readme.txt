Welcome to my QUIC protocol code demo.

This is based on a library I found online called AIOQUIC

Here's the link: https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic

To run the code, open two terminal and run the following commands in each:

    > python server5.py -c cert.pem -k key.pem -v
    > python client5.py -k -v
